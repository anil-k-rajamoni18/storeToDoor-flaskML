        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Increased internet usage has allowed for many technological advancements that provide users and customers with convenient access to the things they desire with just a single click. Businesses are also leveraging the internet for expansion and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The demands and supply chain of customers and business owners are synchronized with the evolving needs and wants.
        </p>
        <p>
            As online communication becomes the norm, businesses are transitioning to e-commerce platforms. This shift has led to increased business growth and sales.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within these e-commerce platforms, the owner and customer interaction is limited to promotional messages and product reviews. There is no scope for direct customer interactions. It needs an effective communication channel to make business transactions easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, the search preferences of the products and pricing vary from person to person. Targeting customers who prefer to choose certain products is the first strategy to implement. To make this easy, customer segmentation plays a major role.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we researched implementing this project, we found that the major problems include effective direct communications to understand customer preferences and reviews. The other problem is marketing to the right audience. If the product or the service is not intended for the specific audience who is looking for it, the marketing goes wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to make the business reach the right audience and show the products to the people, it requires customer segmentation. With this project, we have planned to segment the customers based on their product searches, purchase history, and customer behavior. This allows e-commerce platforms to analyze customer behavior towards the products, deals, etc., and target a particular area of customers during deals. Also, for the customers, it becomes hassle-free from all the unwanted or unperformable stuff.
